# Python codes to compute noise autocorrelation functions (ACFs)

The manuscript has been submitted for publication, a pre-print version is available here.


* The **Codes** folder contains:
  - **Compute_AC_PWS.py** to compute noise ACFs from the raw MeSO-net data and stack them with the Phase Weighted Stack (PWS, [Schimmel and Paulssen, 1997](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/130/2/497/760640)) method (2 days of data at the AYMH station are in the E.AYHM.zip file in the **Data** folder).
  - **Reproduce_Fig_1.py** to reproduce Figure 1 (Map of the Kanto Basin).
  - **Reproduce_Fig_2_3.py** to reproduce Figures 2 and 3 of the paper (Noise and earthquake ACF plots).
  - **Reproduce_Fig_4.py** to reproduce Figure 4 of the paper (Maps of the Kanto Basin basin depth).

* The **Data** folder contains:
  - Four zip files with all the data needed to run the codes and reproduce the figures of the paper. The codes unzip the data automatically

* The **Figures** folder contains the figures from the four codes.
