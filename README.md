# Python codes to compute noise autocorrelation functions (ACFs)

The manuscript has been submitted for publication, a pre-print version is available here.

* The **Codes** folder contains:
  - **Compute_AC_PWS.py** to compute the noise ACFs from raw data and stack them with the Phase Weighted Stack (PWS, [Schimmel and Paulssen, 1997](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/130/2/497/760640)) method (the data in the **Data/Raw** folder need to be uzipped).
  - **Reproduce_Fig_2_3.py** to reproduce Figures 2 and 3 of the paper.
  - **Reproduce_Fig_4.py** to reproduce Figure 4 of the paper.
